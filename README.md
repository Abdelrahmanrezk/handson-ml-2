Machine Learning Notebooks

This will be multiple solutions from different datasets from Kaggle applied on each chapter of the book along with book exercises, alongside solving **Andrew Ng** Machine Learning Course in python.

Also, it includes some of the posts published on LinkedIn by me in Arabic.



All Notebooks have their own explanation for each part of the code.

Also, we have some of the materials from our study either from the Book, online materials, or courses.


## Completed SuperVised Machine Learning Chapters are 1-7:

- The Machine Learning Landscape
- End-to-End Machine Learning Project
- Classification
- Training Models
- SVM
- Decision Tree
- Ensemble Learning and Random Forests

### Arabic Materials 

- Posts (see it first)
- Summary (see it second)
- HyperParams (see it third)
- Then move to notebooks

## Completed Deep Learning Chapters are:

- Introduction to Artificial Neural Network with Keras
