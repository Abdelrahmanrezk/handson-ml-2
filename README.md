Machine Learning Notebooks

This will be multiple solutions from different datasets from Kaggle applied on each chapter of the book along with book exercises, alongside solving **Andrew Ng** Machine Learning Course in python.

Also, it includes some of the posts published on LinkedIn by me in Arabic.



All Notebooks have their own explanation for each part of the code.

Also, we have some of the materials from our study either from the Book, online materials, or courses.


## Completed Machine Learning Chapters are:

- The Machine Learning Landscape
- End-to-End Machine Learning Project
- Classification
- Training Models
- SVM
- Decision Tree



## Completed Deep Learning Chapters are:

- Introduction to Artificial Neural Network with Keras
